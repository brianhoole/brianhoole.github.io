summary: Successfully initiated and maintained a T-Mobile sales business from 2006 - 2010 spanning multiple locations statewide.

Mobile Advantage was an exclusive dealership providing T-Mobile sales and service to clients throughout the island of Oahu. The business was founded in 2006 in a small kiosk of Windward Mall. Over the course of 4 years it grew to 5 locations including Mililani Town Center, Restaurant Row, Pioneer Plaza, and Pearlridge Shopping Center. Employment grew to a team of 35 people company wide. Due to contractral restructuring within T-Mobile, the company shut down in 2010.  

My involvement with this company included everything from initiation to termination. When the opportunity opened for a T-Mobile contract, I immediately began the negotiation process discussing terms and conditions of the business. I was tasked with location discovery and leasing terms, human resources, system implementation and initial capital for inventory. I built computers and rented established software from reputable programmers familiar with the necessities of the wireless industry. Initial employment included myself and now wife; quickly growing to 3 more employees by the end of the first month to meet consumer demand. Business taxes was a long learning experience as I was quickly notified of the amount of profits that needed to go to the government. I became self-taught of intricacies of business and employment tax requirements within 6 months.
