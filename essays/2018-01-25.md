From the dawn of communication, mannerisms have dictated the ways we interact with one another. The exchange of ideas and messages maintained a funadmental courtesy with the way it was delivered. Much of these non-verbal methods of communication carried concepts like respect and temperment that could be received, creating a better environment for a message to be understood. With the utilization of technology, communication has gotten much faster and easier but at the expense of the etiquettes normally encasing them. As the culture of mass communication evolved over time, mannerisms and expectations changed accordingly.

Through the freedoms of the internet; these mass communications organzied into different sectors based on the target demographic. Forums like "Stack Overflow" provide a reliable source of information for programmers and developers alike. As mentioned, with this abundant amount of information comes a "netiquette" to efficiently and productively conduct oneself to maintain the usability of the source. Eric Raymond, author of "How to Ask Questions the Smart Way", formalizes the standard expectations of the open marketplace, how to maximize the forum inquiry experience, and control excessive saturation of repeated topics. Simple efforts can keep the atmosphere positive and constructive without giving temptation to agitate a dispute.
