The automotive industry has come a long way since the invention of the first self propelled vehicle by Ferdinand Verbiest around 1672. From steam power to internal combustion, innovation of techniques to make the automobile more efficient, convenient, and luxurious has never lost momentum. The competative drive of the automotive industry along with new found capabilities of computers keeps engineers busy discovering the next best thing. One thing in particular is autonomous vehicles.

Since the 1920's, automated driving was an idea sought after by all major manufacturers. Originating as a radio controlled car to external  mechanical sensors in the road guiding the vehicle, we have witnessed a vehicle that is able to stand alone and traverse a road with only the input/outputs on it's body governed by it's central computer. Considering when the autonomous vehicle idea was introduced, much of the advancements have been within the last decade. With technology based companies like Google entering the race of autonomated vehicles, the intrusion of the power of the computer will grow.

This is where my skeptical thought process considers the concept of "where there is freedom, there is opportunity for anarchy." I pondered to myself "if I was a terrorist, why not just hack the next update to make all cars turn left at one exact time." Though a ridiculous concept and rather evil to think about, nothing but a solid defense system would stop this from coming true if someone was so inclined to attempt it. This was my moment of clarity of what I felt necessary to apply my skills and knowledge toward; cyber security. Providing defense systems to companies or the government in a drastically ever growing cyber world not only provides greater employment prospects, but a foundation that can be grown upon if the desire to diversify my technological portfolio.  

I personally desire to remain in the automotive industry as I consider it a passion. Otherwise I feel no greater purpose than protecting the country in the military or NSA as a viable option to exploit my skills. If the option to seek my masters degree while employed arrises then I would definately seize the opportunity, preferably funded by the company.
