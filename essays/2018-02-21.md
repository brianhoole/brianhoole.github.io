The definition of framework can extend from the physical form of structures such as buildings, vehicles or objects to abstract functionalities found in computer science providing generic tools for engineers to utilize. These definitions are synonymous in regard to providing a concept of necessity for essential supporting structures within any architecture; the larger the construct, the more support necessary. When dealing with superstructures, being a building or a powerful program, these supporting structures provide a skeleton to build from. This realization creates a logical platform why it is necessary to learn, and continue learning frameworks as they are released.
