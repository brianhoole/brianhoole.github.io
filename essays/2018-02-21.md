framework frame·work/ˈfrāmˌwərk/ (noun) - "an essential supporting structure of a building, vehicle, or object."

The definition of framework can extend from the physical form of structures such as buildings, vehicles or objects to abstract functionalities found in computer science providing generic tools for engineers to utilize. These definitions are synonymous in regard to providing a concept of necessity for essential supporting structures within any architecture; the larger the construct, the more support necessary. When dealing with superstructures, being a building or a powerful program, these supporting structures provide a skeleton to build from. This realization creates a logical platform why it is necessary to learn, and continue learning frameworks as they are released.

A competative market has provided a marketplace of different user interfaces striving to provide the best solution to programmers needs. Each toolbox has it's strengths and weaknesses, left to the developer/programmer to overcome said weaknesses while exploiting it's strengths. This fluidity strengthens skillsets and opens the doors 



The small inconvenience of learning will pay dividends when able to implement at a programmers disposal when dealing with competitors.
Professor Dusko Pavlovic of University of Hawaii at Manoa stated in his final lecture of Fall 2017: "When you graduate, much of what you have learned will already be obsolete. You must keep learning to keep up with the fast moving technology of tomorrow."
