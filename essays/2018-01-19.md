Throughout my experiences learning about the science of giving a machine commands, diversity of language seems to be the most important asset a programmer can have. This programming multilingualism broadens the scope of possibilities the individual can accomplish, understanding fundamental capabilities of each language. After observing the strengths and weaknesses of languages I'm familiar with so far with the confessions of advocates of the different structures, I can confidently suggest a "best" language does not exist but all have their strengths programmers can exploit.

In my pursuit toward programming fluidity, introductions to new languages are met with excitement and an open mind to learn. My Java background reminds me of the similarities to JavaScript, but I notice much less words are needed to accomplish the same task. Leaner code is a satisfaction I frequently enjoy, so my first impression of JavaScript suggests it may become my new favorite language. From an engineering perspective, one of the important aspects of  Then again, my hypothesis might be completely wrong; which fuels my motivation to learn and possibly innovate.
