Throughout history, linguistics has been studied as systems of pattern recognition between entities to exchange information. These patterns would be impossible to function without fundamental standards understood by everyone involved. As communication evolved, new standards accepted and/or denied by the affected culture allowed innovations to find new meanings but never losing sight of the fundamental processes.  

The importance of these standards can be applied to fundamental coding practices that not only preserve the languages but allows them to evolve. Innovation stems from dynamic thinking from multiple viewpoints which risk suffocation by huddles in communcation. Strong coding habits enable colleagues and developers to be efficient, precise and innovative when conducting code tracing.
